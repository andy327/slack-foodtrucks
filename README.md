# Foodtruck locator for Slack!

This repository contains (well, it *will* contain) instructions on how to add a custom Slack integration that queries a website to list foodtrucks in your area! A like to eat at food trucks when I'm at work, and sometimes it's good to have an idea of what's around before walking around the block. So I created a Scala app using the Play framework which I deploy to Heroku, and added integration to Slack, so the user can enter `/foodtrucks` and get a listing of what's nearby.
